        "\n",
        "Concept: Both Ridge and Lasso are variations of linear regression that add a penalty term to the model to prevent it from becoming too complex and overfitting the data. Overfitting happens when the model fits too closely to the training data, including noise, leading to poor performance on new data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Ridge (L2 Regularization): Adds a penalty proportional to the square of the coefficients.\n",
        "Lasso (L1 Regularization): Adds a penalty proportional to the absolute value of the coefficients, which encourages sparsity (some features may be entirely ignored).\n",
        "Intuition: Imagine you’re fitting a line to data, but you want to keep the model simple and avoid letting it become too influenced by outliers or noise. Adding a penalty forces the model to choose smaller weights for the features, leading to a simpler, more general model.\n",

        "Concept: Decision trees divide the data into distinct branches based on different features, leading to a tree-like structure. In each leaf of the tree, the predicted value is the average of the target variable for the instances in that leaf.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuition: Instead of fitting a line or a curve, you are \"splitting\" the data based on conditions (e.g., is feature X greater than 5?). Each split creates a smaller group of data points, and you predict the target as the average value for that group.\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: \"If the house has more than 3 bedrooms, predict a higher price. Otherwise, predict a lower price.\"\n",

        "Goal: Combine multiple decision trees to improve prediction accuracy and reduce overfitting.\n",

        "Concept: Random forests build many decision trees and average their predictions to get a more robust result. This reduces the tendency of individual trees to overfit the data.\n",
        "\n",
        "Intuition: Imagine you have many decision trees, each making a prediction. Instead of trusting just one tree, you trust the majority vote (for classification) or the average (for regression) of many trees. This ensemble approach reduces overfitting and improves the generalization ability of the model.\n",

        "Intuition: Decision trees are simple to understand. They break down complex decision-making into a series of yes/no questions, which makes them very interpretable. The leaves of the tree represent the class labels, and the path from the root to the leaf is determined by feature values.\n",

        "Intuition: By aggregating many decision trees, random forests reduce the risk of overfitting that single decision trees often suffer from. Since each tree is trained on different data and features, the ensemble approach leads to more stable and accurate predictions.\n",

The network learns the weights of the connections between neurons during training, adjusting them to minimize the classification error. Neural networks are highly flexible and can approximate complex functions.\n",
        "Intuition: Neural networks are inspired by the human brain. Each layer in the network transforms the data, and after many transformations, the network is able to classify data based on learned patterns. For classification, the final layer typically uses a softmax function to output probabilities for each class.\n",

        "Intuition: Instead of training all trees independently like in random forests, boosting trains each tree to improve upon the mistakes of the previous tree. It corrects the errors made by earlier trees, resulting in a strong, robust model.\n",

        "Intuition: Imagine you have a group of objects.
